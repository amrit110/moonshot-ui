# MLHC Setup


## Steps to build the modified moonshot-ui

1. Clone this fork to a project folder say ``mlhc-hackathon``
2. Create python virtual environment and install the moonshot python library.

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
python3 -m pip install aiverify-moonshot prisma bcrypt
```
3. Make sure you have all the other prerequisites installed. Check the main README.md of the project for details.

```bash
cd moonshot-ui
npm install
```

4. Initialize and setup prisma DB for managing users.

```bash
prisma migrate dev --name init
```

5. Add users

Use the ``add_user.py`` to add users with email and password details.

6. Set the URL and port in the ``.env.local`` file. It is important that the URL to the app is correctly set in the .env.local
file to make sure that the routing works correctly. Specifically, the ``NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`` and ``NEXTAUTH_URL`` needs to be
updated to the URL of the app.

7. Build the app

```bash
cd moonshot-ui
npm run build
```

8. From the outer directory (i.e. project folder), run:

```bash
python3 -m moonshot web
```
